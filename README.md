# Building a simple poll with Shiny

This simple app utilizes modules and promises to show possible paths torwards scaling Shiny. This is a simple excercise I built.

 This code makes use of the libraries, [fireData](https://github.com/Kohze/fireData), promises, future and [data.table](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table).
